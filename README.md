## Problem Statement üìù
Cryptocurrency markets are known for their extreme volatility, making price prediction a significant challenge. This project aims to tackle this by developing a robust time-series prediction model using LSTM to forecast cryptocurrency prices and uncover future trends. The implementation leverages automated and modular pipeline orchestration to streamline model retraining and updates. A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit brings these forecasts to life, enabling real-time predictions and insights in a production-ready environment.

## Training Pipeline üöÇ
In this pipeline, we embark on a journey through various steps to train our model! 

üõ§Ô∏è Here's the process breakdown:

1. **run_pipeline.py**: Initiates the training pipeline.
2. **ingest_data:** Fetchs raw data from MongoDB using an API into a pandas DataFrame.
3. **clean_data:** Removes unnecessary columns, handle missing values, and prepare the data for processing.
4. **feature_engineering:** Create and scale features to optimize model performance.
5. **steps/data_splitter:** Split the dataset into training and testing subsets for validation.
6. **steps/model_training:** Trains an LSTM model and track it using [MLflow autologging](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html).
7. **steps/model_evaluation:** Evaluate the model and log performance metrics with MLflow autologging [MLflow autologging](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html).

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment Pipeline ‚öôÔ∏è
The continuous integration pipeline focuses on the production environment and streamlined processes for deployment. 

üîÑ Here's how it flows:

1. **deployment_pipeline.py:** Defines the continuous deployment pipeline, which trains the model and deploys it using the MLFlow model deployer step.
2. **run_deployment.py:** Handles the execution of the deployment pipeline and provides an option to stop the prediction service once the deployment is complete.
3. **dynamic_importer.py:** Imports test data dynamically, reshaping it to match the expected model input for predictions.
4. **prediction_service_loader.py:** Retrieves the prediction service started by the deployment pipeline to ensure the model is ready for inference.
5. **predictor.py:** Takes the loaded prediction service and input data, reshapes the data as needed, and performs predictions on it.
